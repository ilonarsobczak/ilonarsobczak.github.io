            <p><strong>Hello, my name is Ilona Sobczak</strong> </p>
            <p>Thank you for your interest. Please let me briefly introduce myself: I have dual citizenship (American/Belgian). I originally come from Belgium, but my job brought me to the US in 1993. Since I have lived and worked for more than half of my life in the US, I became trilingual (German / French / English), which is my greatest asset as a translator and interpreter. I acquired permanent residence through my employer in 2002 and US citizenship independently in 2009. </p>
